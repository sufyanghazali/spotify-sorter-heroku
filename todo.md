# App

-   deploy to heroku **DONE**
-   restructure components as class components **DONE**

# Main Features

-   get and render playlists **DONE**
-   get and render songs from playlist **DONE**
-   sort playlist and render changes **DONE**
-   save sorted playlist **DONE**
-   get full list of songs from playlist **DONE**

# Components

-   playlists **DONE**
-   playlist songs **DONE**

# Possible Expansions

-   select all/multiple playlists to sort
-   add database to accomodate returning users so they can have settings

# Possible Improvements

-   **Work on mobile interface**
    -   playlist list and playlist should be different screens
-   show playlist details (song count and stuff...)
-   show user profile
-   refine compare() so that songs with same release date are ordered by album order
-   could probably refactor SortButton and SaveButton into one component
-   refactor fetching playlist items, so I don't have repeating GET requests
-   work on user interface
